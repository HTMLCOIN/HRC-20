# HTMLCOIN Token Template

This is the template for Tokens creation on HTMLCOIN blockchain.

It has basic functions, so any extra features need to be developed on top of these standards.

Please have in mind that some standards can’t be changed as the Desktop Wallet expects a few specific function names, parameters and behaviours.

The video below explains how to implement your own Token:
